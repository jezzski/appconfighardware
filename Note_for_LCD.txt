Open the "Libraries" in PIO Home, you could search "tft_espi" and the first one should be it (tft_eSPI by Bodmer). Add it to your project.
Then, copy User_Setup.h file to "\.pio\libdeps\nodemcu-32s\TFT_eSPI" and replace the existing file.
After that, you could just run the sample code ("LCD_sample.cpp") and that's it. (๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧  Make sure your project is under the Ardunio framework.

Connection: (It's configured in the User_Setup file and could be changed to other ports if preferred)
TFT_MOSI 23    to SDA
TFT_SCLK 18    to SCL
TFT_DC    2   to DC
TFT_RST   4  to RES
