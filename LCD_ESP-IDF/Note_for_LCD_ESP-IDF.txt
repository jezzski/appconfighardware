Steps to make it work:

1. Unzip the src file, put all the files into src folder of your project. (main.c is a sample code.)
2. Unzip the data file, put data folder in your project folder (it should be on the same level as src folder).
   Files in the data folder will later be uploaded to the ESP32 (spiffs stuff...).
3. put "partitions_example.csv" in your project folder.
4. Add "board_build.partitions = partitions_example.csv" to your platformio.ini.

5. Build, upload and monitor.
6. In the "Project tasks" window, click "upload filesystem image" (Under "Platform" tab).
7. That's it. (〃￣︶￣)人(￣︶￣〃)

Note:
Connection is configured the same as the one used for the Arduino platform. It could be changed under the main.c (a bunch of defines at the beginning of the file).
Data folder contains fonts and pictures used by the sample code.
